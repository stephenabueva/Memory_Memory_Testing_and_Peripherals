1. Why do we need to perform memory testing?
  A memory test verifies the functionality of each storage location in a memory device. When the prototype hardware is completed, the designer must confirm that the address and data lines are connected properly and that the memory chips are operating as intended by doing memory testing.
It can be understood by doing a simple task: Write some set of Data values to each Address in Memory and read it back to verify. This is a fundamental principle used in testing.
